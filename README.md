# sinewavecity

Sine Wave City is an arcade game where you control a sine wave. You control the frequency and phase of your wave. As blips and other objects spawn, you must maneuver the tops of your sine wave to stop the objects.

Original development began in GameMaker Studio. Progress is underway (3/25/23) porting this to Godot.

Porting progress:
- [âœ”] level 1 logic
- [ ] blaster
- [ ] vertical sine wave
- [ ] horizontal lasers
- [ ] laser spawner
- [ ] laser whirlpool
- [ ] level 1 timings + sound
- [ ] levels 2-4

Future ideas:
- static vaporwave backgrounds for levels
- better "sine wave city" background: vaporwave sun sets, background changes.
- retrowave sunset background has a music visualizer
- check controller sensitivity for boyee controller
- hit point indicator, city in ruins
- level progress indicator, ribbon minimap?
- resource management, slow down phase?
- level 4 -- trap ship
- level 3 outro -- story for taking wavelord alive
- survival mode\par
- easy/medium/hard
- glitching sine wave
- EMP to kill all bombs
- EMP to put your wave in stasis, so you have to plan out where you want your sine wave beforehand
- level 4/5 difficulty idea: sine wave glitches to the beat, phase to a direction per second
- global high score, plus high score for each leve\par
- railgun charge indicator\par
- boss in the center, send stuff out in all directions\par


Steam release self notes:
run downloads/steamworks_sdk/build_sine_wave_city
then publish in steamworks online \par

Random notes for me to parse later:
Terminal, font size 100 -- neon glow effect size 20\par
